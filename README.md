# Markdown as an API
A Node library to convert Markdown to usable javascript objects, just like you would with a REST request.

## Philosophy
With minimal effort markdown is easy to understand and writable for everyone.
This makes Markdown ideal for non-programmers as well.
Instead of providing a CMS we should aim to treat content as code.
As an important bonus your site can be statically generated, which comes with it's own benefits.
